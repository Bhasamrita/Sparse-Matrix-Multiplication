# Sparse-Matrix-Multiplication
This is an attempt at creating two sparse matrices by randomly generating the positions of the elements as well as the elements themselves. Thereafter the multiplication is done using only the non-zero elements. Two graphs are drawn showcasing the number of calculations as well as storage space required to multiply two 10X10 matrices applying this sparse method vs normal matrix multiplication. This method performs worse than the conventional method when the matrices are densely filled. But once the density goes below 50%, then this method performs way better than the conventional method.
